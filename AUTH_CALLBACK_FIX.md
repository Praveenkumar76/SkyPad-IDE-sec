# Auth Callback 404 Fix

## ✅ Current Status

Your authentication callback setup is **correctly configured**:

1. ✅ `AuthCallback.jsx` component exists and is well-implemented
2. ✅ Route `/auth/callback` is registered in `App.jsx`
3. ✅ Backend properly redirects to `http://localhost:5173/auth/callback?token=...`

## 🐛 Why You Got 404

The 404 error you saw was likely due to:
- Frontend dev server not running
- Stale browser cache
- React Router not properly loaded

## 🚀 Solution Steps

### Step 1: Restart Frontend
```bash
cd C:\projects\SkyPad-IDE\frontend
npm run dev
```

Wait for:
```
  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  press h + enter to show help
```

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (hard refresh)
- Or open DevTools → Application → Clear Storage → Clear site data

### Step 3: Test Authentication Flow

1. **Go to login page**: `http://localhost:5173/login`

2. **Click "Continue with Google"** button

3. **After Google auth**, you should be redirected to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173/auth/callback?token=eyJhbGc...
   ```

4. **You should see**:
   - Loading spinner: "Completing Sign In..."
   - Success checkmark: "Success! Redirecting to your dashboard..."
   - Then redirect to dashboard

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

After restarting, verify:

- [ ] Frontend is running on http://localhost:5173
- [ ] Backend is running on http://localhost:5000
- [ ] Can access http://localhost:5173/auth/callback directly (should show loading state)
- [ ] No console errors about missing components

## 📋 What the AuthCallback Component Does

Located at: `frontend/src/components/AuthCallback.jsx`

**Functionality:**
1. ✅ Extracts `token` from URL query parameters
2. ✅ Decodes JWT to get user info
3. ✅ Stores in localStorage:
   - `token`
   - `userName`
   - `userEmail`
   - `userAvatar`
   - `userId`
4. ✅ Redirects to `/dashboard` after 1 second
5. ✅ Handles errors and redirects to `/login` on failure

## 🎨 Component Features

- **Loading State**: Shows spinner with "Completing Sign In..."
- **Success State**: Green checkmark with "Success!"
- **Error State**: Red X with error message
- **Beautiful UI**: Backdrop blur with gradient background
- **Back Button**: Can return to login if needed

## 🔧 Route Configuration

In `App.jsx` (line 58):
```jsx
<Route path="/auth/callback" element={<AuthCallback />} />
```

This route is now positioned early in the route list to ensure it's matched correctly.

## 🌐 Backend Configuration

Backend redirect (from `backend/src/routes/auth.js` line 242):
```javascript
const frontendUrl = process.env.FRONTEND_URL || 'http://localhost:5173';
const redirectUrl = `${frontendUrl}/auth/callback?token=${token}`;
res.redirect(redirectUrl);
```

## ✨ Expected Flow

```
User clicks "Google Sign In"
    ↓
Frontend redirects to: /api/auth/google/oauth
    ↓
Backend redirects to Google
    ↓
User authorizes on Google
    ↓
Google redirects to: /api/auth/google/callback
    ↓
Backend creates JWT token
    ↓
Backend redirects to: http://localhost:5173/auth/callback?token=...
    ↓
AuthCallback component:
  1. Extracts token
  2. Saves to localStorage
  3. Shows success message
  4. Redirects to /dashboard
```

## 🐛 If Still Not Working

1. **Check browser console** for React errors
2. **Check backend logs** for redirect URL
3. **Try direct URL**: http://localhost:5173/auth/callback
   - Should show "No authentication token received"
4. **Verify token in URL** when redirected from Google
5. **Check FRONTEND_URL** in backend/.env

## 📝 Notes

- The route is **not protected** (no ProtectedRoute wrapper) - This is correct!
- The component handles its own error states
- Token is validated client-side (JWT decode)
- Server-side validation happens on subsequent API calls

Your setup is correct. Just restart the frontend! 🚀
