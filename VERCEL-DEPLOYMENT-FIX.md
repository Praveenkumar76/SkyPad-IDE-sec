# Vercel Deployment Fix Guide

## üîç Understanding the Problem

### What the Error Means
```
Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE ..." is not valid JSON
```

This error occurs when your frontend code expects a JSON response from the API (e.g., `{"success": true, "token": "..."}`), but instead receives an HTML page. The `<` is the first character of `<!DOCTYPE html>`, which is how every HTML page starts.

### The Root Cause
Your browser console shows:
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
```

**This is the real problem.**

#### What's Happening:

1. ‚úÖ **Your "Sign in" button is clicked**
2. ‚úÖ **Your JavaScript code tries to send email/password to an API endpoint** (like `/api/auth/login`)
3. ‚ùå **On Vercel, that API endpoint cannot be found (404)**
4. ‚ùå **Vercel returns its default "404 Not Found" HTML page**
5. ‚ùå **Your code, expecting JSON, tries to parse the HTML page and crashes**

## üèóÔ∏è Your Architecture

Your project uses a **separate frontend and backend** architecture:

- **Frontend**: React/Vite app ‚Üí Deployed on **Vercel**
- **Backend**: Express/Node.js API ‚Üí Deployed on **Render** (https://skypad-ide.onrender.com)

This is **NOT** a Next.js full-stack app, so Vercel doesn't have your API routes. Your frontend needs to communicate with the separate backend on Render.

## ‚úÖ The Solution

### Step 1: Set Environment Variable in Vercel

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
3. Add a new environment variable:
   - **Name**: `VITE_BACKEND_URL`
   - **Value**: `https://skypad-ide.onrender.com/api`
   - **Environment**: Select all (Production, Preview, Development)

4. Click **Save**
5. **Redeploy your application** (Vercel ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Redeploy)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: In Vite, environment variables MUST start with `VITE_` to be exposed to the client-side code.

### Step 2: Verify Backend is Running

Visit these URLs in your browser:

1. **Backend Health Check**: https://skypad-ide.onrender.com/api/health
   - Should return: `{"status":"ok","timestamp":"...","uptime":...}`

2. **Backend Root**: https://skypad-ide.onrender.com
   - Should return: `SkyPad-IDE API is running`

If these don't work, your backend on Render is down or not deployed.

### Step 3: Check CORS Configuration

Your backend CORS is already configured to allow all origins (which is fine for development/testing):

```javascript
// backend/src/server.js (line 27)
app.use(cors());
```

For production, you might want to restrict this to your Vercel domain:

```javascript
const corsOptions = {
  origin: [
    'https://your-app.vercel.app',
    'http://localhost:5173', // for local development
    'http://localhost:5000'
  ],
  credentials: true
};
app.use(cors(corsOptions));
```

### Step 4: Verify Frontend API Configuration

Your `frontend/src/utils/api.js` is already set up correctly:

```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_BACKEND_URL || 
  (window.location.hostname === 'localhost' 
    ? 'http://localhost:5000/api' 
    : 'https://skypad-ide.onrender.com/api');
```

This means:
- If `VITE_BACKEND_URL` is set in Vercel ‚Üí uses that
- If running on localhost ‚Üí uses `http://localhost:5000/api`
- Otherwise ‚Üí falls back to `https://skypad-ide.onrender.com/api`

## üß™ Testing

### Local Testing
1. Start backend: `cd backend && npm run dev`
2. Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Open http://localhost:5173
4. Try logging in

### Production Testing
1. Deploy to Vercel with environment variable set
2. Open your Vercel app URL
3. Open browser DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Network tab
4. Try logging in
5. Check the request to `/api/auth/login`:
   - **Should go to**: `https://skypad-ide.onrender.com/api/auth/login`
   - **Should return**: JSON response with `{token: "...", user: {...}}`

## üö® Common Issues

### Issue 1: Backend Returns 404

**Symptoms**: 
- API endpoint not found
- HTML page instead of JSON

**Solutions**:
- Verify backend is deployed and running on Render
- Check the API URL is correct (no typos)
- Ensure route files are correctly named (case-sensitive on Linux)

### Issue 2: CORS Errors

**Symptoms**:
```
Access to fetch at 'https://...' from origin 'https://...' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

**Solutions**:
- Add your Vercel domain to CORS allowed origins
- Ensure credentials are properly configured

### Issue 3: Environment Variable Not Set

**Symptoms**:
- Frontend tries to call `/api/auth/login` on Vercel domain
- Gets 404 because Vercel doesn't have backend

**Solutions**:
- Verify `VITE_BACKEND_URL` is set in Vercel
- Redeploy after adding environment variable
- Check build logs for environment variables

### Issue 4: Render Backend Sleeping

**Symptoms**:
- First request takes 30+ seconds
- Backend eventually works

**Solutions**:
- Render free tier puts apps to sleep after inactivity
- Upgrade to paid tier for always-on
- Or accept the cold start delay

## üìù Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Backend deployed on Render
- [ ] Backend health check returns OK
- [ ] CORS configured to allow Vercel domain
- [ ] Environment variable `VITE_BACKEND_URL` set in Vercel
- [ ] Frontend redeployed after setting environment variable
- [ ] Tested login/register in production
- [ ] Browser DevTools shows correct API URL

## üîß Updated Files

I've improved the error handling in your API utilities to provide better error messages when the backend is unavailable.

## üéØ Quick Fix Summary

**The fastest fix right now:**

1. **Set `VITE_BACKEND_URL` in Vercel** ‚Üí `https://skypad-ide.onrender.com/api`
2. **Redeploy your app**
3. **Test login**

That's it! Your frontend will now properly connect to your backend on Render.
