### Step-by-Step Usage

#### 1. Add Problems to Database
Before creating challenges, you need problems in the database:
- Go to the **Problems** page
- Click **"Upload Question"**
- Fill in the problem details:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard)

5. You'll be redirected to the **Lobby**

#### 5. In the Lobby (Both Players)

- Both players will see:
  - Room ID
  - Problem title and difficulty
  - Both participants (Host üëë and Opponent ‚öîÔ∏è)
- A **3-second countdown** will start
- Both players are automatically redirected to the **IDE**

#### 6. In the IDE (During Match)

  - Language selector
  - Run Code button (for testing)
  - Submit button (for final submission)
  
**Real-time Features:**
- Match timer (counting up)
- Notification when opponent submits
- Instant win/loss determination

**To Win:**
- Be the first to submit code that passes all test cases
- Click **"Submit"** to evaluate your code
- If all test cases pass, you win!

#### 7. Results Page

After someone wins:
- Both players are redirected to results
- Winner sees congratulations
- Loser sees encouragement message
- Match statistics displayed
- Options to:
  - Go back to challenges
  - Request a rematch

## Features

### Search & Filter
- **Search**: Type keywords to find problems by title or description
- **Filters**: Click Easy, Medium, or Hard to filter by difficulty
- **Real-time**: Results update as you type

### Real-time Communication
- WebSocket-based real-time updates
- Opponent joining notifications
- Match countdown synchronization
- Code submission notifications
- Winner determination

### Multi-language Support
- JavaScript
- Python
- C++
- Java

Each language has starter code templates.

### Match Flow
1. **Waiting** (2 min max) ‚Üí Host waits for opponent
2. **Starting** ‚Üí 3-second countdown
3. **In Progress** ‚Üí Both players code
4. **Finished** ‚Üí Winner determined, results shown

## Fallback Behavior

If the database is empty or unreachable:
- The system uses **sample problems** (5 Easy problems)
- You can still create and join rooms
- All features work normally

Sample problems included:
1. Two Sum
2. Reverse String
3. Valid Parentheses
4. Fibonacci Number
5. Factorial

## API Endpoints

### Frontend ‚Üí Backend

```javascript
// Get all problems
GET /api/problems

// Create a challenge room
POST /api/challenges/rooms/create
Body: { problemId: string }

// Join a challenge room
POST /api/challenges/rooms/join
Body: { roomId: string }

// Get room details
GET /api/challenges/rooms/:roomId

// Submit code
POST /api/challenges/rooms/:roomId/submit
Body: { code: string, language: string }
```

### WebSocket Events

**Client ‚Üí Server:**
- `join-room` - Join a challenge room
- `leave-room` - Leave a challenge room
- `code-submitted` - Notify code submission

**Server ‚Üí Client:**
- `room-joined` - Confirmation of room join
- `opponent-joined` - Opponent has joined
- `match-countdown` - 3, 2, 1 countdown
- `match-started` - Match begins
- `match-finished` - Winner determined
- `room-expired` - Room expired
- `error` - Error occurred

## Database Schema

### ChallengeRoom
```javascript
{
  roomId: String (unique, format: ABC-123),
  problemId: String,
  hostUserId: ObjectId (ref: User),
  opponentUserId: ObjectId (ref: User),
  status: ['waiting', 'starting', 'in_progress', 'finished', 'expired'],
  winnerId: ObjectId (ref: User),
  lobbyExpiresAt: Date,
  startedAt: Date,
  finishedAt: Date,
  submissions: [{
    userId, code, language, result, testResults, submittedAt
  }],
  matchDuration: Number (seconds)
}
```

### Problem
```javascript
{
  problemId: String (unique),
  title: String,
  description: String,
  difficulty: ['Easy', 'Medium', 'Hard'],
  topic: String,
  constraints: String,
  sampleTestCases: [{ input, expectedOutput, explanation }],
  hiddenTestCases: [{ input, expectedOutput }],
  allowedLanguages: [String],
  points: Number,
  isActive: Boolean
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Problem 1: "No problems available"
**Solution**: Add problems to the database via the Problems page, or use the fallback sample problems.

### Problem 2: "Room not found"
**Solution**: 
- Check if the Room ID is correct (format: ABC-123)
- Room may have expired (2-minute limit)
- Create a new room

### Problem 3: "Database not available"
**Solution**: 
- Ensure MongoDB is running
- Check backend connection string in `.env`
- System will use sample problems as fallback

### Problem 4: Match not starting
**Solution**:
- Ensure both users are logged in
- Check browser console for WebSocket errors
- Refresh both pages
- Create a new room

### Problem 5: Socket connection failed
**Solution**:
- Check if backend server is running
- Verify CORS settings
- Check JWT token in localStorage
- Try logging out and back in

## Technical Details

### Authentication
- JWT tokens required for all API calls
- Token stored in localStorage
- Token included in WebSocket handshake

### Timer Management
- Lobby timer: 2 minutes (120 seconds)
- Countdown timer: 3 seconds
- Match timer: Unlimited (counts up from 00:00)

### Code Execution
Currently using **mock execution** (always passes for testing).

For production, integrate with:
- Judge0 API
- Docker containers
- AWS Lambda
- Custom sandboxed execution

### State Management
- React useState for local state
- WebSocket for real-time state synchronization
- MongoDB for persistent state

## Future Improvements

1. **Real Code Execution**
   - Integrate Judge0 or similar service
   - Run code against actual test cases
   - Memory and time limit enforcement

2. **Spectator Mode**
   - Allow others to watch ongoing matches
   - Live leaderboard

3. **Tournament Mode**
   - Multi-round tournaments
   - Bracket system
   - Prize pool

4. **Replay System**
   - Watch past matches
   - Learn from top coders

5. **Rating System**
   - ELO-based ratings
   - Leaderboards
   - Rank progression

6. **Matchmaking**
   - Auto-match with similar skill level
   - Quick play mode

7. **Problem Difficulty Adjustment**
   - Dynamic difficulty based on player skill
   - Handicap system
