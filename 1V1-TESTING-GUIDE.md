8. In IDE â†’ Check "code-submitted" events
9. After winner â†’ Check "match-finished" event
10. On results page â†’ Socket should still be connected
```

### Test 5: Error Handling
```
1. Join with invalid Room ID â†’ See error
2. Try to join expired room â†’ See error
3. Submit empty code â†’ See validation message
4. Submit code with syntax error â†’ See error feedback
5. Close browser mid-match â†’ Opponent should still be able to finish
```

## Expected Behaviors

### Countdown (3-2-1)
- Each number displays for 1 second
- Animated pulse effect on each number
- "Get ready to code! âš¡" message
- Both players redirect simultaneously

### Test Results Display
```
Run Code:
âœ“ Sample Test 1 - Passed
âœ“ Sample Test 2 - Passed
âœ“ Sample Test 3 - Passed

Submit:
âœ… ALL TEST CASES PASSED!
Result: ACCEPTED
Tests Passed: 8/8
ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You won the match!
```

### Results Page
**Winner Sees:**
- ðŸŽ‰ Icon
- "Congratulations! You Won!"
- Match summary (duration, problem, difficulty)
- Rewards section (rating, achievements, XP)
- Winner badge on their card

**Loser Sees:**
- ðŸ’ª Icon  
- "Better Luck Next Time!"
- Random encouragement phrase
- Match summary
- No rewards section
- Winner badge on opponent's card

## Debug Console Messages

Look for these in browser console:

```javascript
// Socket Events
"User connected: {username}"
"Room joined: {roomId}"
"Opponent joined"
"Match countdown: 3"
"Match countdown: 2"
"Match countdown: 1"
"Match started"
"Opponent submitted"
"Match finished, winner: {userId}"

// API Calls
"POST /api/challenges/rooms/create"
"POST /api/challenges/rooms/join"
"GET /api/challenges/rooms/{roomId}"
"POST /api/challenges/rooms/{roomId}/submit"
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Socket not connecting
**Solution:** Check `VITE_BACKEND_URL` environment variable

### Issue: Room not found
**Solution:** Verify MongoDB is running and connected

### Issue: Test cases not running
**Solution:** Ensure problem has `hiddenTestCases` array in database

### Issue: Countdown skips numbers
**Solution:** Check server logs for socket event timing

### Issue: Winner not determined
**Solution:** Verify backend `/submit` endpoint logic

### Issue: Results page shows wrong winner
**Solution:** Check `location.state.isWinner` in navigation

## Performance Checks

- [ ] Room creation < 500ms
- [ ] Room join < 300ms
- [ ] Countdown timing accurate (Â±100ms)
- [ ] Code submission < 2s
- [ ] Results page load < 500ms
- [ ] Socket latency < 50ms

## Browser Compatibility

Test on:
- [ ] Chrome/Edge (Chromium)

- [ ] Mobile browsers (responsive design)

## Load Testing (Optional)

```
1. Create 5 simultaneous rooms
2. Join all with different users
3. All start matches at same time
4. Submit code simultaneously
5. Verify all matches complete correctly
6. Check server logs for errors
```
