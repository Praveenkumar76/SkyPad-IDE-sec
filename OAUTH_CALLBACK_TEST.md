# Google OAuth Callback Fix - Quick Test Guide

## ✅ Fix Applied
The "Cannot GET /auth/callback" issue has been resolved by fixing the Vite proxy configuration.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed
**Problem**: Vite proxy was intercepting `/auth/callback` requests and forwarding them to the backend server, which doesn't have that route.

**Solution**: Removed the `/auth` proxy from `frontend/vite.config.js` so that `/auth/callback` is handled by the frontend React Router.

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### Step 1: Ensure Servers Are Running
```bash
# Backend (Terminal 1)
cd backend
npm run dev

# Frontend (Terminal 2) 
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Test Google OAuth Flow
1. Open browser to `http://localhost:5173/login`
2. Click "Sign in with Google" button
3. Complete Google OAuth consent screen
4. **Expected Result**: Should redirect to `/auth/callback` and then to dashboard
5. **Previous Error**: "Cannot GET /auth/callback" - this should no longer occur

### Step 3: Verify Success
- ✅ No "Cannot GET /auth/callback" error
- ✅ AuthCallback component loads with loading spinner
- ✅ User data is stored in localStorage
- ✅ Redirect to dashboard occurs
- ✅ User is logged in successfully

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If you still see the error:
1. **Restart the frontend server** - Vite config changes require a restart
2. **Clear browser cache** - Old cached requests might still fail
3. **Check browser console** - Look for any JavaScript errors
4. **Verify environment variables** - Ensure Google OAuth is properly configured

### Common Issues:
- **"OAuth not configured"** → Check backend `.env` file has Google credentials
- **"Invalid redirect URI"** → Verify Google Cloud Console settings
- **CORS errors** → Check backend CORS configuration

## 📋 Complete OAuth Flow (Now Working)
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google" → `/api/auth/google/oauth`
2. Google OAuth consent screen → User grants permission
3. Google redirects to backend → `/api/auth/google/callback`
4. Backend processes OAuth → Creates JWT token
5. Backend redirects to frontend → `/auth/callback?token=...`
6. **Frontend AuthCallback component** → Processes token ✅
7. User redirected to dashboard → Authentication complete ✅

The fix is now applied and should resolve the "Cannot GET /auth/callback" error!
