## üìñ Overview  

**CodeLab ‚Äî Collaborative Coding Playground** is a **web-based collaborative coding platform** built on the **MERN stack**. It enables multiple users to **write, edit, run, and debug code together in real-time**, making remote coding as seamless as sitting side by side.  

The platform is designed for **developers, students, and educators** who want to:  
- Collaborate on coding projects  
- Practice and prepare for technical interviews  
- Host or participate in coding hackathons  
- Compete in live multiplayer coding challenges  
- Strengthen problem-solving skills through curated practice problems  

Unlike traditional IDEs, CodeLab integrates **real-time code synchronization, an in-browser terminal, and optional voice/video communication**, creating a **complete ecosystem for collaborative programming and interactive learning**.  

By combining **real-time collaboration, intuitive UI/UX, and scalable backend services**, CodeLab transforms coding from a solitary activity into a **social, engaging, and competitive experience**.  

## ‚ùì Problem Statement  

Traditional coding platforms and IDEs are designed mainly for **individual use**.  
This creates challenges such as:  
- Limited support for **real-time collaboration** between developers.  
- Lack of an **integrated communication system** (chat/voice/video) within coding environments.  
- Difficulty in hosting **coding challenges or hackathons** without external tools.  
- Inefficient workflow for **students and educators** who want to learn or teach together interactively.  

As a result, coding often becomes an **isolated and less engaging activity**, reducing opportunities for teamwork, peer learning, and competitive practice.  

## üéØ Mission  

Our mission with **CodeLab** is to transform coding from an **isolated task** into a **collaborative, engaging, and social experience**.  
We believe that coding should not only be about solving problems individually, but also about **learning together, sharing knowledge, and building in real-time**.  

By integrating collaboration, communication, and competition into a single platform, we aim to:  
- Encourage **peer-to-peer learning** among students, educators, and developers.  
- Provide a space for **remote teams** to collaborate seamlessly without technical barriers.  
- Make **coding challenges and hackathons** more accessible, interactive, and fun.  
- Foster a **community-driven environment** that motivates users to improve their problem-solving skills.  

**Vision:** To become the go-to platform for **collaborative coding and interactive learning**, enabling users worldwide to connect, practice, and grow together. 

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

- Mobile-friendly version of CodeLab  

## üèÜ Outcomes  

With **CodeLab**, users can achieve:  

- **Seamless Collaboration** ‚Äì Work together on the same codebase in real-time, just like Google Docs for coding.  
- **Interactive Learning** ‚Äì Students and educators can learn, teach, and solve problems collaboratively.  
- **Competitive Practice** ‚Äì Participate in multiplayer coding challenges and hackathons to sharpen problem-solving skills.  
- **Practical Experience** ‚Äì Developers gain real-world teamwork exposure, preparing them for remote pair programming and technical interviews.  
- **Community Growth** ‚Äì Build connections with peers, mentors, and colleagues in an engaging coding environment.
