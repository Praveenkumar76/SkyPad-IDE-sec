# Code Editor Port Fix Summary

## üêõ Problem Identified

The Code Editor was showing "Disconnected" with multiple `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` errors because of a **port mismatch**:

- **Frontend was trying to connect to**: `http://localhost:3002`
- **Backend was actually running on**: `http://localhost:4000`

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed CodeEditor.jsx
**File**: `frontend/src/components/CodeEditor.jsx`

**Changed Line 96:**
```javascript
// Before (WRONG)
const CODE_EDITOR_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_CODE_EDITOR_URL || 'http://localhost:3002';

// After (CORRECT)
const CODE_EDITOR_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_CODE_EDITOR_URL || 'http://localhost:4000';
```

### 2. Updated Frontend Environment Variables
**File**: `frontend/.env`

**Added:**
```env
VITE_CODE_EDITOR_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

## üöÄ How to Test

1. **Make sure backend is running:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   You should see:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Backend listening on http://localhost:5000
   ‚úÖ WebSocket server ready
   
   üöÄ Starting Code Editor Server...
   ‚úÖ Code Editor Server starting on port 4000
   üöÄ Code Editor WebSocket server running on port 4000
   ```

2. **Restart your frontend** (if it was already running):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   Or just refresh your browser with `Ctrl+Shift+R` (hard refresh)

3. **Navigate to the Code Editor page**
   - The connection status should now show: **"Connected"** (green dot)
   - Try running some code - it should work!

## üìù What Ports Are Used

| Service | Port | URL |
|---------|------|-----|
| Main Backend | 5000 | http://localhost:5000 |
| Code Editor WebSocket | 4000 | http://localhost:4000 |
| Frontend Dev Server | 5173 | http://localhost:5173 |

## üîç Verification Steps

After fixing and restarting:

1. **Check Code Editor Connection Status**
   - Should show green dot with "Connected"
   
2. **Open Browser Console**
   - Should see: `‚úÖ Connected to Code Editor server`
   - Should NOT see any `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` errors

3. **Try Running Code**
   - Type some code (e.g., `console.log("Hello")` in JavaScript)
   - Click "Run Code"
   - Should see output in the output panel

## üéØ Root Cause

The original code was hardcoded to connect to port `3002`, which was likely from an old configuration. The backend was configured to run on port `4000` (as seen in `backend/.env` with `CODE_EDITOR_PORT=4000`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Improvements

To avoid this issue in the future:
1. Always check `backend/.env` for the correct `CODE_EDITOR_PORT`
2. Ensure `frontend/.env` has matching `VITE_CODE_EDITOR_URL`
3. The code now respects the environment variable, so you can easily change ports by updating `.env` files

## ‚ú® Result

The Code Editor should now connect successfully and be able to execute code in multiple languages (JavaScript, Python, C++, Java, C) with real-time output! üéâ
